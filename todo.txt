Determine if, where, and how large of capacitors are needed for each motor driver.
-see TMC2209 charge pump pins
-see recommended filtering for TMC2209 VS

Calculate total power draw of system

fan driver mosfet choice incorrect. Change or investigate 4 pin fan option.
probably use this mosfet https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/panjit-international-inc/PJC7400-R1-00001/14660010

Verify fan control is mapped to a pwm pin

Mike says to disconnect USB shield from ground.

Try UART_MODE_RS485_HALF_DUPLEX with esp32 to see if it simplifies UART control

Add more caps to motor vcc

switch out usbc connector with through hole version, or use part from JLC and buy assembly

-- LAyout::-----------

verify fan mosfet footprint

add test point pads

esd module might be too difficult to hand solder

choose esp32 wroom 1 module without octal psram:
https://www.atomic14.com/2023/11/21/esp32-s3-pins.html

choose proper led footprint for both power smd and indicator LEDs

Switch has incorrorect pads. Cannot find correct pad from datasheet :(

verify fan connector for chosen fan.

verify fan polarity

verify fuse slot for chosen fuse
