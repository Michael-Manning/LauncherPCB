Determine if, where, and how large of capacitors are needed for each motor driver.

choose proper led footprint for both power smd and indicator LEDs

Find out why in this video, the usb pins on the esp32 don't match up with the datasheet,
or find more examples of pins 25 and 26 being used for usb connection

Calculate total power draw of system

solenoide driver

connectors for endstops and potentiometers

4 endstop inputs with voltage dividers for 5v reading

map all unused IO to header pins

how does transister hfe work? The datasheet gives a bunch of values. Must tune base resistor for 
led driver

is it fine to have the usb and battery connected at the same time? There will be two 5V and 3.3V 
sources which could cause current flow between them. Maybe a diode on the outputs are enough?

Should I power the LEDs with the 3.3v or 5v rail?

Test before ordering:

- ESP32 hardware UART both rx and tx tied together.

- address multiple controllers on same line

- verify copy and pasted usb regulator design and resistor values
