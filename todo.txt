Determine if, where, and how large of capacitors are needed for each motor driver.
-see TMC2209 charge pump pins
-see recommended filtering for TMC2209 VS

choose motor sense resistors or investigate if internal sense resistors are sufficient

choose proper led footprint

Find out why in this video, the usb pins on the esp32 don't match up with the datasheet,

Add more XT60 connectors to distribute power to ESC controllers. Calculate total power draw of system

PWM fan connector

on board thermister?

servo connector

map all unused IO to header pins

hall effect sensor IO. Need level shifting?

Test before ordering:

- ESP32 hardware UART both rx and tx tied together.

- address multiple controllers on same line
