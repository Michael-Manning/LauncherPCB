-- LAyout::-----------

update via sizes to cheaper option in jlcpcb quote page.

support forums imply that the mimum annular ring section of the capabilities only refers to holes for through hole 
components. The hole and via size restrictions are specified seperately as 0.15 preffered minimum hole and total diameter
size of 0.15 larger than the hole. To meet cheap manufacturing option, set vias to 0.3 hole and 0.45 diameter

Go through Dan's notes.
