verify motor connector pins spacing.

Go through Dan's notes.

Change eps32 thermal pad via sizes

Could order double row female headers of an exact length instead of cutting them up myself if they're cheap.

verify TMC module pins one more time. 

Order double sided motor female JST cables, or find a way to adapt current cables to board.
NOTE: 
	It seems like some motor cables use a 4 pin connector on the board instead of another 6 pin.
	If I went with the 4 pin 2.5mm connector, I might even be able to use my current header style 
	connectors for some time before buying/making proper cables.


	Should see what's most widely availble and go with that. 
	Could also see how hard it is to crimp my own connectors. Could make my own custom length cables.
